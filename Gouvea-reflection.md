#Elaine Gouvea's Reflection:
____
* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

>Create, fork and clone Repos, Pull request, Fetch and Merge.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

>Create, fork and clone Repos

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

>How to fork, what is fetch, how to merge.

* What still confuses you about Git?

>Fetch and Merge, conflict.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

>It was very frustating. I've panicked with pairing at my first GPS. I felt like I has holding back my peer instead of helping him. I have this old concept in my mind that I'm not the best when working under the gun. Inner critic! I'm trying to work on it.
